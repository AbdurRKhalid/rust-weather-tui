# Weather Application - A Terminal User Interface

The basic information regarding current weather can be found on the terminal using this very basic Rust Application.

## Basic Mode
If you want to see the current day's weather report, pass the command-line arguments with the city name, for example, Berlin, and then normal, like the following:

`cargo run -- Berlin normal`

## Detail Mode
If you want to see the weather report for the upcoming days as well, then pass the command-line arguments with city name and detail, like the following:

`cargo run -- Berlin detail`
